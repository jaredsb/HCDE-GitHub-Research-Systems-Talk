# Welcome to our Repo for the GitHub Research Systems Talk!!!

## Problem statement
GitHub is commited to making the worlds best developer tools. To do this we need to reach out to talented candidates in the design and research community. To attract these new candidates we are updating GitHub's recruitment resources including our recruitment websites to speak more effectively to new candidates.
