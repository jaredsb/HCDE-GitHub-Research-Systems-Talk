# Reseach on applicant attitudes

## ðŸ¤” Research question: Why are so many applicants dropping before uploading resumes or portfolios? 

### Required years of experience seem to high to some applicants

> "A lot of these job postings are from big companies, like FAANG or adjacent. I think I might have a better chance at a smaller, lesser known company and I don't know what those companies might be. I also struggle with junior or associate positions that state you need 3 or 5 years experience. How is that even junior!?!?"

### Portfolios are a lot of work and don't represent my experience

> "The biggest pain points I've found include building a portfolio that's succinct, complete and accurately reflects who I am and what I do. Another pain point with the portfolio is including the right kind and amount of information."
